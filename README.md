# DotPoint

Video game coded in C++ using the SFML graphics library

# Gameplay
Rules of the game are similar to the snake game. Your character (the dot) must move around and collect coins in time. If a time limit for collecting a coin is exceeded, you lose

# Why SFML?
SFML is highly efficient since it is a graphics library for a low-level language like C++. This game could be easily replicated in Python, but efficiency of code would be nowhere near SFML. This was a learning experience for me, but working on this project has given me a much better understanding of graphics in C++ and SFML syntax/usage
